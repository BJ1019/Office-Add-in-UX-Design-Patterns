# Office Add-in UX Design Patterns
This repository is a library of common UX design patterns for Office Add-ins. It represents a set of best practices for add-in interfaces. The patterns are built using Office UI Fabric components and styling. They complement Office experiences and follow add-in UX design principles. As you design your own Office Add-in, refer to the patterns, download the templates to quickly create your own mock-ups using Adobe Illustrator, or download the [code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code "code").

Current Fabric Version Used: [2.6.1](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-core/releases/tag/2.6.1)

##Tips & Tricks
* These templates are vector files produced with Adobe Illustrator or .ai files.
* The files are produced at 200% size to accommodate high resolution screens.
* All pattern files contain simplified versions of the Office applications in the background. Refer to the helpful add-in templates for more accurate backgrounds.
* When designing with these assets please keep the following in mind:
 * Copy the add-in UI from a pattern file and place into the Office Add-in template of your choice.
 * Icon assets have been converted to outlines and reproduced at 200% to match
 * Font sizes similarly produced at 200%: 11pt = 22pt
 * To open, edit and design with these templates, we assume you have a  Segoe UI font.
 * Some files contain linked files from the folder called "Embedded Backgrounds".
 * Some common elements used across files have been created as symbols. These can be found in the "Embedded Symbols" folder.
