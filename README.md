# Office Add-in UX Design Patterns

This repository is a library of common UX design patterns for Office Add-ins. It represents a set of best practices for add-in interfaces. The patterns are built using Office UI Fabric components and styling. They complement Office experiences and follow add-in UX design principles. As you design your own Office Add-in, refer to the design patterns list below.

To download the entire set of code samples navigate to the following repo:  [Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code "Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns-Code").
